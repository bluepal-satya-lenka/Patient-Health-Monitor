1. Installing Dependencies

1.1 nx-arangodb – Library for working with ArangoDB and NetworkX (for graph-based machine learning).
1.2 cugraph-cu12 – NVIDIA’s cuGraph library for GPU-accelerated graph algorithms.
1.2 langchain, langgraph, langchain-community, langchain-openai, langchain-together – Libraries for creating LLM-based workflows and connecting to AI models (OpenAI, Together AI, etc.).
1.3 langchain_groq – Integration with Groq, an AI model hosting service.
1.4 nvidia-smi – Outputs information about the GPU (if available).
1.5 nvcc --version – Outputs the installed CUDA version.

2. Importing Required Libraries

2.1 json – Built-in Python module for parsing JSON files.
2.2 networkx (nx) – Library for creating and analyzing graphs.
2.3 plotly.graph_objects – Plotly module for visualizing graphs and other interactive plots.

3. Loading JSON Data

3.1 diseases_35.json – Contains information about 35 diseases (likely a list of dictionaries).
3.2 patients_550.json – Contains information about 550 patients.
3.3 edges_corrected_100.json – Describes relationships between diseases and patients (likely as an edge list).

4. Creating the Graph and Adding Nodes

4.1 nx.Graph() – Creates an undirected graph (for bidirectional relationships).
4.2 add_node() – Adds nodes to the graph:
-----id – Unique node identifier.
-----label – Human-readable label (e.g., name).
-----type – Type of node (disease or patient).

5. Adding Edges Between Nodes

5.1 add_edge() – Creates an edge (connection) between two nodes.
5.2 relationship – Stores edge metadata (like type of interaction).

6. Creating a Plotly Visualization

6.1 edge_x, edge_y – Store x, y coordinates for edges.
6.2 edge_trace – Defines the edge visualization.
6.3 node_x, node_y, node_text – Store node properties (position, label).
6.4 node_trace – Defines the node visualization.
6.5 go.Figure() – Combines edge and node traces into a single plot.
6.6 fig.show() – Renders the plot in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

7. ArangoDB Integration

7.1 ArangoClient – Establishes connection to the ArangoDB instance.
7.2 client.db() – Connects to the _system database using provided credentials.
7.3 Persist the NetworkX data to a graph within ArangoDB.

8.GROQ API Setup

8.1 GROQ API key is stored in environment variables.
8.2 Groq() initializes a connection to the GROQ model.

9.Tool 1 – Natural Language to AQL to Text

9.1 ChatGroq() – Initializes the LLM with qwen-2.5-32b model.
9.2 ArangoGraphQAChain.from_llm() – Sets up LangChain to convert natural language to AQL.
9.3 chain.invoke(query) – Executes the generated AQL query in ArangoDB.
9.4 Returns the result in natural language.

10.Tool 2 – Natural Language to AQL to NetworkX

10.1 GROQ generates Python code using qwen-2.5-coder-32b model.
10.2 The code is extracted using regex and executed using exec().

11.Query Handler

11.1 If the query mentions "visualize" or "show," it triggers the visualization tool.
11.2 Otherwise, it triggers the text-based result tool.

12.Execution Flow

12.1  Executes a sample query.
12.2 Outputs text result or generates a visualization.
