# 🏥 Patient Health Care Monitor: AI-Driven Patient Journey & Risk Analytics Platform
This repository contains the development notebooks for the Patient Health Care Monitor project, created for the ArangoDB Hackathon: **"Building the Next-Gen Agentic App with GraphRAG & NVIDIA cuGraph."**

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission
This project is our submission for the ArangoDB Hackathon on Devpost, where we've created an agentic healthcare application integrating GraphRAG and GPU-accelerated graph analytics with NVIDIA cuGraph.

## 📊 Project Overview
Patient Health Care Monitor is an AI-powered healthcare platform designed to monitor and analyze patient journeys and health risks using graph-based data models, AI reasoning, and GPU acceleration. The platform enables healthcare professionals to:

✅ Visualize complete patient medical journeys  
✅ Identify high-risk patients through graph analytics  
✅ Discover treatment patterns and correlations  
✅ Query medical data using natural language  
✅ Analyze complex medical relationships with graph algorithms  


## 📓 Repository Contents

1. **STEPS_Patient_Health_Care_Monitor.ipynb**  
   This notebook develops the core platform in step-by-step progression:  
   - **Step 0:** Package installation and environment setup  
   - **Step 1:** Dataset preparation and initial analysis  
   - **Step 2:** Converting and loading graph data into NetworkX with GPU acceleration  
   - **Step 3:** Persisting the graph in ArangoDB  
   - **Step 4:** Building the agentic application with LangChain & LangGraph  
   - **Step 5:** Visualizing the data using Plotly
